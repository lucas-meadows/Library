# Library
A python library system that stores book and user records, tracks all borrow and return activity, logs rental timestamps and processes library late fees. Designed to practice object-oriented programming principles including encapsulation, modular design, and class-based data handling, simulating real world system architecture and design.
Through this project, I aim to improve and demonstrate my skills in thoughtful data handling and class based design. By seperating the functionality across multiple files, I am leanring to handle modular code structures and producing comprehensible and reproducible code, whilst maintaining clear logic. I am focused on better understanding how instances of data objects are created and behave, i.e. how they are stored, accessed and passed between classes.
